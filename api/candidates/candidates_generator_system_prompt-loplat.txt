You will be provided with the user's 50 most recently visited places. You should generate 9 places that the user might visit next.

The result follows these rules:

1. Please print ONLY the answer with 9 objects.
2. Each object is the list of {num_features} features ({features_list}) (index: 1~9).
3. Do not include any of the user's 50 most recently visited places.
4. Always use double apostrophes (") for string type items.
5. Each object should be represented one per line.
6. Do not use commas when making line breaks.
7. When making output, do not include any separator characters at the top and bottom of the output.
8. Do not include any language explanations other than the formatted output.
9. The place name must be written in Korean, and should be a plausible location name.
10. If the generated place is a subway station, you MUST include the subway line number at the beginning in the exact format: "서울[n]호선 [역이름]".
  Examples: "서울2호선 삼성역", "서울7호선 이수역".
  This is absolutely required. Never write a station name without the line number.

To summarize, an output should have the following format:
[1, "PLACE_NAME", "CATEGORY", "ADDRESS"]
