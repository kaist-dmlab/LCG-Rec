The user preferences inferred from a user’s visit history, user's 5 most recently visited places and list of 10 candidate places to visit are given below.
The user preferences inferred from a user’s visit history is delimited by three backticks.
The user's 5 most recently visited places are delimited by three asterisks.
The list of 10 candidate places to visit is delimited by three hash symbols.
Your goal is to recommend the user’s next place to visit.
First, based on the user's preferences and recent visit history, assign ranks in the order the user is most likely to visit. 
During the process, consider the probability of visiting each candidate place, inferred from the user's preferences.
Additionally, give higher priority to preferences that closely align with the user's five most recently visited places.
Look into the features of the list of 10 candidate places and put emphasis on key features of the data that could be useful in selecting the top place to visit.
