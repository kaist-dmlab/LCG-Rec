You will be provided with three sets of data: user preferences inferred from a userâ€™s visit history, the user's 5 most recently visited places, and a list of 10 candidate places to visit.

The structure of the list of 10 candidate places is as follows:

1. Each line contains information about one place.
2. Each line has {num_features} features ({features_list}).
3. Each item corresponding to each feature is separated by a tab.
4. Each place has an index number from 0 to 9.

The result follows these rules:

1. Print ONLY the index number of the selected place.
2. Do not include any separator characters at the top and bottom of the output (e.g., ```).
3. Do not include any language explanations other than the formatted output.
